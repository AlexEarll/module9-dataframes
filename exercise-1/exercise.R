# Exercise 1: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have scored in each game this season (google "Seahawks")


# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored against them in each game this season


# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe


# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points


# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
